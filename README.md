# NLP
This project uses NLP to understand using Natural language processing, the difference between the top 10 marvel and DC movies and understands their insights
We have taken the top ten highest grossing movies of Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC Extended Universe and compared their scripts to explore intersting insights from them
Summary of Insights:

1. It can tell you the leads characters of the movie based on frequency of their names. This is specially in ensemble movies like Avengers or Justice League
2. Marvel movies have an average words of around 80-85 compared to over 100 words per minute by DC. Based on the numbers, people prefer slower speech since it is catering to global audiences
3. People prefer more repetitions of words and not a lot of new words through the entire movie as evident from the analysis
4. On an average, movies which are around 2 hour 10 minutes to 2 hour 30 minutes tend to do better than other movies
5. According to the analysis, movies with a lot of cuss words do not do well on an average but suprisingly movies with 4-5 occurrences of (sh*t) have raked a lot of money.
6. Movies which are not very opinionated or dark tend to do much better than the ones which are opinionated.
